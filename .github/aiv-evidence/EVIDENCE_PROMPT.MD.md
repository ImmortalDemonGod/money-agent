## Classification (required)

```yaml
classification:
  risk_tier: R3
  sod_mode: S1
  critical_surfaces: []
  blast_radius: "PROMPT.md"
  classification_rationale: "R3 because this prompt governs unsupervised privilege boundaries and conclusion behavior under a real identity"

```

## Claim(s)

1. The run agent is instructed that only facts-lane human resolutions count and direct companion-bet resolution cannot close a request
2. No existing tests were modified or deleted during this change.

## Evidence

### Class E (Intent Alignment)

- **Link:** [https://github.com/ImmortalDemonGod/money-agent/commit/e07aefd61e52f61d314cc211df056ee312793da3](https://github.com/ImmortalDemonGod/money-agent/commit/e07aefd61e52f61d314cc211df056ee312793da3)
- **Requirements Verified:** Keep the autonomy prompt aligned with the mechanically enforced actuation boundary

### Class B (Referential Evidence)

**Scope Inventory** (SHA: [`8f307cf`](https://github.com/ImmortalDemonGod/money-agent/tree/8f307cf8c950e7e485ba355de9d8d33dded8bde1))

- [`PROMPT.md#L54-L58`](https://github.com/ImmortalDemonGod/money-agent/blob/8f307cf8c950e7e485ba355de9d8d33dded8bde1/PROMPT.md#L54-L58)

### Class A (Execution Evidence)

**WARNING:** No tests found that directly import or reference the changed file.
This file has no claim-specific execution evidence.

### Code Quality (Linting & Types)

- **ruff:** All checks passed
- **mypy:** Found 1 error in 1 file (errors prevented further checking)

### Class C (Negative Evidence)

**Search methodology:** Ran `git diff --cached` and scanned for regression indicators.

- Test file deletions: **none**
- Test file modifications: **none**
- Deleted assertions (`assert` removals in diff): **none found**
- Added skip markers (`@pytest.mark.skip`, `@unittest.skip`): **none found**

### Class F (Provenance Evidence)

**Test file chain-of-custody:**

No covering test files found.

**Recent test directory history** (`git log --oneline -5 -- tests/`):

## Claim Verification Matrix

| # | Claim | Type | Evidence | Verdict |
|---|-------|------|----------|---------|

| 2 | No existing tests were modified or deleted during this chang... | structural | Class C: all structural indicators clean | PASS VERIFIED |

**Verdict summary:** 1 verified, 0 unverified, 1 manual review.

## Verification Methodology

**Zero-Touch Mandate:** Verifier inspects artifacts only.
Evidence collected by `aiv commit` running: git diff (scope inventory), pytest (no claim-specific tests found), anti-cheat scan.
Ruff/mypy results are in Code Quality (not Class A) because they prove syntax/types, not behavior.

## Summary

Align agent instructions with facts-lane actuation resolution
